	<p id="format">My past job is nothing like my dreamjob.
	However it tought me several things that can be applied to my dream job.
	That Dreamjob for me would be working for SpaceX or NASA creating machines capable of interstelar travel.
	I have Always wanted to create planes and spaceships and that dream seems to be getting closer everyday.
